                        Hi, thanks for coming to take a look at my
                        work. My name is Brian and I look forward to
                        getting to know you!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My wife and I have a 2 year old little girl.
                        We also have a cat, named Gatsby, that my wife
                        likes more than I do. He's okay, I guess.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my spare time, if Iâ€™m not coding, I like
                        fixing cars and motorcycles and watching
                        movies. Check out what movies I've been
                        watching on the reviews page.

                        project, I'm learning ASP.NET and C#.

                        I don't know the answer to every question, but
                        do know how to find those answers and I love
                        the process. I love learning new skills and
                        finding new ways to solve problems.

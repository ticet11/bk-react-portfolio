                        I don't know the answer to every question, but
                        do know how to find those answers and I love
                        the process. I love learning new skills and
                        finding new ways to solve problems. Recently,
                        that has meant exploring game development in
                        lua and Love2D.

                        I have been exploring the bounds of technology
                        since I was a little kid, taking old
                        electronics apart or figuring out how to get
                        Red Alert on the old Windows 95 computer.

                        Due to my diverse job history, I have an
                        understanding of several varied industries
                        that allows me to understand problems from
                        many perspectives. My solution to a problem
                        will likely be different from yours and I
                        think that's an incredible asset in
                        development.

                        In my spare time, if Iâ€™m not coding, I like
                        fixing cars and motorcycles and watching
                        movies. You can check out what movies I've
